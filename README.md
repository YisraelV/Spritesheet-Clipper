When using a spritesheet, finding the accurate coordinates of the individual images can be a demanding task.

This program enables you to to this visually, by creating rectangles around the areas you are interested in.

Features:

1. create rectangles
2. zoom in\out by pressing SHIFT +\- (zooming does not affect the coordinates, it is just a visual aid)
3. save\load locations from locations.json file. The file is in format "[{"left": number, "top": number, "width": number, "height": number}...]"
